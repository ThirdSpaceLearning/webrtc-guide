# WebRTC Guide
A step-by-step tutorial guide to help understand the process of building a WebRTC application.

# Using it
As it stands, you can install this code to a webserver, and just click through the steps. You will need two Chrome browsers (preferably on the same intranet.) One should be designated the local, which initiates the call, and the other is the remote. All tasks in black (rendered in the middle of the bar) should be executed by both browsers. Those on the left (in green) are for the local browser, while those on the right are for the remote only.

Whenever a 'signalling' message appears, copy the appropriate data from that browser to the other.

I hope to produce a video walkthrough at some point.
